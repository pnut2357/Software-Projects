To open the file and run, it is necessary to link .h library file and .cpp file.
To link them, an object file .o should be created. Type the command: g++ -c -Wall
Choi_Jaehyuk_assn5.cpp. After creating the object file, type the command: make to 
link all the .cpp and .h files. Then, type: ./run to run the program. 

Please remember that it takes a while to read an entire noble if the .txt file is 
large.
