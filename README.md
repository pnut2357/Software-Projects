# Software-Projects C++
This program is a High-Low-Guess card game based on singly linked-list data structure in C++. The bag contains 54 bag nodes as a singly linked-list, and each bag node has a pointer to each card structure that contains each card information: suit and value of a card. At the starting point, a card is drawn with the output of the analysis of probabilities for the left cards in the deck. Then, the user have three choices to guess 1) if the value the next card is higher, 2) lower, or 3) the exact value of the next card. For the option 1) and 2), the user earns 1 point with correct guess, continuing the game. The option 3) requests prompt of guess from the user so if the guess is right, the user earns 5 points. If the guess is not right, the program terminates and outputs "GAME OVER".
