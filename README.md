Tuition Calculator reads 'students.dat' file and stores the information as Student object in an array-list. By an enhanced for loop, a tuition for each Student is calculated by polymorphic method calls. The tuition is uniquely calculated depending on the type of student (on-campus or online student). The class writes the student list in 'tuition.dat' with the calculated tuitions in descending order based on the amount of the calculated tuitions.

The following figure is the class UML diagram.
